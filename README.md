# Frontend Nanodegree Arcade Game: Bugs!

This project is part of the [Udacity Frontend Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) and focuses on Object Oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

The graphics and game engine were provided by Udacity.

## Play the game
Play the game: [Bugs!](http://kkufieta.github.io/arcadeGameBugs/).

Move the hero by pressing the arrows Up, Down, Left or Right.
Pause the game by pressing SPACE.
Avoid the bugs, collect the gems, hearts, keys and stars. When you get a star, you can kill the bugs and reduce their number.

## Download
There are no dependencies, simply clone the game with

`git clone https://github.com/kkufieta/arcadeGameBugs.git`

or [download it here](https://github.com/kkufieta/arcadeGameBugs/archive/master.zip).

## TO DO / Collaboration sought to do

1. The board (at least the special tiles such as gems) should be reset when the player collides with a bug, or when the game is over and is reset again to the initial setup.
2. Utilize more of the graphic assets: Let the user choose the player, make it clearer that the star means you can kill bugs now, give the gems special powers, make the game generally more interesting, challenging and fun.
